# Mobile Developing

## Native way

- If I want to develop for android, I would need to code in Java or Kotlin then build an APK.
  So, I would need to recreate the same app with Object-C or Swift to build an IPA (iOS). This way is not maintainable since I would need to do same things twice as much.

## Cross platform

- Using javascript I can create a JS Bundle, that will compile into an APK or IPA. In the same code basing I can do everything. Also, with React Native its possible to create system specific features.
