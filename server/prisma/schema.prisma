  //String is relative to enviroment, prisma will convert it according to DB. In SQL String turns into VARCHAR. If I want to use a specific DB type, I can use @db.VarChar(char_quantity)
  id         String  @id @default(uuid()) //@id means that this is the primary key. To do an autoincrement with prisma, I have to change it to id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) using UUID I'll prevent user from being able to see every ID just chaning URL. UUID Generates an UNIVERSAL UNIQUE ID. Example: 6c83193b-ec47-40f0-8808-8a63f8249046
  type       String
  comment    String
  screenshot String? // ? at type means that this field is nullable, or doens't have NOT NULL prop.

  //This will create table with name "feedbacks" instead of "Feedback"

//To execute above script I must run "npx prisma migrate dev or deploy" into terminal
//To see DB into a studio I can run npx prisma studio
